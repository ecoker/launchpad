You are bootstrapping a new project: **test-app**, a real-time web chat app with no persistent memory built using Elixir + Phoenix.

**Your instructions:**
- Follow `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for always-on standards (functional-first, clean, explicit).
- Follow `.github/instructions/` for specific conventions on architecture, collaboration, and Elixir/Phoenix code.
- Build in small, composable modules with clear context boundaries.
- Push side effects to the edge and keep the core pure.
- Use Phoenix contexts for core concepts and pattern match on function boundaries.
- Keep PRs minimal, focused, and clear—leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.
- Collaborate by reading and respecting all project instructions and established patterns.

Produce an initial commit that scaffolds the minimal working app structure in accordance with these standards.
