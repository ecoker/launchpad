# Agent Collaboration Rules

- Respect `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as the global default.
- Apply matching `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files based on file type and task.
- Prefer minimal, focused diffs that solve root causes.
- Keep implementation and tests aligned with project conventions.
