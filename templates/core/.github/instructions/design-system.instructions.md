# Design system

Every app generated by this system should feel **cohesive** — like it came from
the same studio, regardless of framework or language. This file establishes the
visual baseline. Specific palette or font assets may refine these defaults, but
these principles always apply.

## Dark-first

- Default to a **dark color scheme**. Light mode is optional but dark mode
  should look intentional, not bolted-on.
- Background surfaces should use near-black tones, slightly elevated surfaces
  a step lighter, and borders subtly lighter still. Aim for 3–4 distinct
  surface levels that create depth without harsh contrast.
- Text should be soft white with muted secondary text.
- Never use pure `#000000` backgrounds or pure `#ffffff` text — the contrast is
  harsh and fatiguing.

> **Note:** If a palette asset is selected, its specific color tokens replace
> the generic color guidance below. The principles (dark-first, restrained
> accent, semantic status colors) always apply — only the concrete values change.

## Color attitude

- Keep the palette **restrained**. One accent color family plus semantic status
  colors (green for success, red for danger, amber for warning).
- Accent color should be **vibrant but not neon** — indigo, blue, or violet
  family by default.
- Use color to **signal meaning**, not to decorate. If everything is colorful,
  nothing stands out.

## Typography

- **Sans-serif for UI text.** Use Inter, the system sans-serif stack, or a
  similar geometric sans. Never default to serif fonts for application UI.
- **Monospace for code and data.** Use JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or the system
  monospace stack for code blocks, log output, IDs, and diagnostic info.
- **Two families maximum.** One sans, one mono. Don't introduce more unless the
  design explicitly calls for it.
- Base font size: `15–16px`. Line height: `1.5–1.6`. These are readable on
  screens without being oversized.

## Spacing and rhythm

- Use a **consistent spacing scale** (4px base: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64).
  Every margin, padding, and gap should come from this scale.
- Prefer the framework's spacing system (Tailwind's scale, Flutter's EdgeInsets
  constants, etc.) over arbitrary pixel values.
- **Whitespace is design.** When in doubt, add more space, not less. Cramped
  layouts feel cheap; generous spacing feels polished.

## Component DNA

- **Rounded corners**: subtle, not bubbly. `border-radius: 6–8px` for cards and
  containers, `4px` for inputs and buttons. Not `0` (harsh) or `16px+` (playful).
- **Borders**: thin (`1px`) and low-contrast against the surface. Borders should
  separate, not shout.
- **Shadows**: minimal in dark mode (they don't work well on dark backgrounds).
  Use subtle elevation via surface color shifts instead.
- **Hover/focus states**: always present, always visible. Use background color
  shifts and ring outlines, not just color changes alone.

## Visual energy

Apps should feel **alive**, not flat. Dark mode is not an excuse for dull.

- **Gradient accents.** Use subtle gradients on hero sections, CTAs, and feature
  cards. Linear gradients from your accent color to a shifted variant (e.g.
  indigo → violet, blue → cyan). Not everywhere — just where you want the eye
  to land.
- **Glow effects.** Buttons and accent elements can have a soft glow:
  `box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(accent, 0.3)`. Use sparingly — one or two glowing
  elements per page, not everything.
- **Surface depth.** Create visual layers: base background → elevated cards →
  highlighted elements. Each layer should be subtly lighter than the one below.
  Three to four distinct surface levels is ideal.
- **Vibrant icons.** Icon badges and feature indicators should have colored
  backgrounds (soft accent tints) rather than sitting on plain surfaces.
- **Section contrast.** Alternate between dark and slightly lighter sections to
  create visual rhythm in long pages. Use gradient transitions between sections
  rather than hard color breaks.
- **Typography weight.** Headlines should feel bold and confident. Use `font-weight:
  700-800` for hero text. Pair with lighter body text (`400`) for contrast.

## Layout

- Default to a **single-column centered layout** for content-heavy pages, with
  a sensible max-width (`64rem` / `1024px`).
- Use **sidebar navigation** for apps with multiple sections, **top nav** for
  simpler sites.
- Cards, lists, and data tables are the primary content containers. Keep them
  visually consistent.

## Framework-specific notes

These principles apply regardless of framework, but the implementation varies.
**Tailwind CSS is the default styling system for all web frameworks** — define
theme tokens in `tailwind.config` and use utility classes everywhere. Don't
scatter hex values or raw spacing numbers across templates.

- **Phoenix/LiveView**: Tailwind ships with `mix phx.new`. Define theme tokens
  in `tailwind.config.js` and set CSS custom properties in the root layout for
  any non-Tailwind contexts (JS hooks, third-party widgets).
- **Rails**: Tailwind is a first-class default via `tailwindcss-rails`. Define
  tokens in `tailwind.config.js`. Use the asset pipeline.
- **SvelteKit**: Tailwind via `@sveltejs/adapter` or PostCSS. Define tokens in
  `tailwind.config.js`. Svelte scoped styles can supplement but shouldn't
  replace Tailwind for layout and spacing.
- **Next.js / React**: Tailwind is the default. Configure in `tailwind.config`.
  Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging.
- **Django**: Tailwind via `django-tailwind` or manual PostCSS setup. Define
  tokens in `tailwind.config.js`. Reference in templates.
- **Laravel**: Tailwind ships with Vite + Laravel. Define tokens in config.
  Blade components and Livewire components use Tailwind utilities.
- **Flutter**: no CSS. Define `ThemeData` with palette tokens. Use `ColorScheme`
  for semantic color mapping. `ThemeExtension` for custom tokens.

## Override behavior

This file provides **defaults**. If a specific palette asset is selected, its
color tokens replace the generic color guidance above. If a font asset is
selected, its font families replace the generic typography defaults. The
principles (dark-first, restrained color, consistent spacing) always apply —
only the concrete values change.

## The test

If you put screenshots of two different apps generated by this system side by
side, a person should think: "These look like they're from the same team."
That's the bar.
