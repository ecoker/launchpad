# Design system

Every app generated by this system should feel **cohesive** — like it came from
the same studio, regardless of framework or language. This file establishes the
visual baseline. Specific palette or font assets may refine these defaults, but
these principles always apply.

## Dark-first

- Default to a **dark color scheme**. Light mode is optional but dark mode
  should look intentional, not bolted-on.
- Use near-black backgrounds (`#0f0f0f`–`#141414`), slightly elevated surfaces
  (`#1a1a1a`–`#1e1e1e`), and subtle borders (`#2a2a2a`–`#303030`).
- Text should be soft white (`#e4e4e7`) with muted secondary text (`#71717a`).
- Never use pure `#000000` backgrounds or pure `#ffffff` text — the contrast is
  harsh and fatiguing.

## Color attitude

- Keep the palette **restrained**. One accent color (blue/indigo/violet family
  by default), plus semantic status colors (green for success, red for danger,
  amber for warning).
- Accent color should be **vibrant but not neon**: think `#6366f1` (indigo) or
  `#3b82f6` (blue), not `#00ff00`.
- Use color to **signal meaning**, not to decorate. If everything is colorful,
  nothing stands out.

## Typography

- **Sans-serif for UI text.** Use Inter, the system sans-serif stack, or a
  similar geometric sans. Never default to serif fonts for application UI.
- **Monospace for code and data.** Use JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or the system
  monospace stack for code blocks, log output, IDs, and diagnostic info.
- **Two families maximum.** One sans, one mono. Don't introduce more unless the
  design explicitly calls for it.
- Base font size: `15–16px`. Line height: `1.5–1.6`. These are readable on
  screens without being oversized.

## Spacing and rhythm

- Use a **consistent spacing scale** (4px base: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64).
  Every margin, padding, and gap should come from this scale.
- Prefer the framework's spacing system (Tailwind's scale, Flutter's EdgeInsets
  constants, etc.) over arbitrary pixel values.
- **Whitespace is design.** When in doubt, add more space, not less. Cramped
  layouts feel cheap; generous spacing feels polished.

## Component DNA

- **Rounded corners**: subtle, not bubbly. `border-radius: 6–8px` for cards and
  containers, `4px` for inputs and buttons. Not `0` (harsh) or `16px+` (playful).
- **Borders**: thin (`1px`) and low-contrast against the surface. Borders should
  separate, not shout.
- **Shadows**: minimal in dark mode (they don't work well on dark backgrounds).
  Use subtle elevation via surface color shifts instead.
- **Hover/focus states**: always present, always visible. Use background color
  shifts and ring outlines, not just color changes alone.

## Layout

- Default to a **single-column centered layout** for content-heavy pages, with
  a sensible max-width (`64rem` / `1024px`).
- Use **sidebar navigation** for apps with multiple sections, **top nav** for
  simpler sites.
- Cards, lists, and data tables are the primary content containers. Keep them
  visually consistent.

## Framework-specific notes

These principles apply regardless of framework, but the implementation varies:

- **Tailwind CSS**: define theme tokens in `tailwind.config` and use utility
  classes. Don't scatter hex values across components.
- **Phoenix/LiveView**: set CSS custom properties in the root layout. Use
  Tailwind or a similar utility system.
- **Rails**: configure Tailwind or define CSS custom properties in
  `application.css`. Use the asset pipeline.
- **Flutter**: define `ThemeData` with the palette tokens. Use `ColorScheme`
  for semantic color mapping.
- **SvelteKit**: define CSS custom properties in the root layout or use
  Tailwind config.

## The test

If you put screenshots of two different apps generated by this system side by
side, a person should think: "These look like they're from the same team."
That's the bar.
