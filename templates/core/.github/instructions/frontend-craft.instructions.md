# Frontend craftsmanship rules

- Build visually balanced, accessible interfaces by default.
- Keep component APIs small, typed, and composable.
- Prefer `shadcn/ui` component primitives for consistent design composition.
- Use Tailwind utility patterns with spacing and typography discipline.
- Use Motion transitions to improve comprehension and perceived quality.
- Keep state and effects intentional; avoid unnecessary complexity.
