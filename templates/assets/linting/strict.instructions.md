# Linting: Strict Mode

## Guidance
- Treat lint warnings as build blockers for application code
- Enforce formatting and import ordering consistently
- Reject dead code and unused symbols in CI
- Keep local fix commands documented in README and start prompt

## Application Rule
Starter tasks should include lint setup plus a command that fails on warnings.
