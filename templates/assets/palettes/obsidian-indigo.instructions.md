# Palette: Obsidian + Indigo

Dark-first palette inspired by your Phoenix LiveView layout styling.

## Guidance
- Use near-black background and slightly elevated surfaces
- Keep border contrast subtle to avoid visual noise
- Use indigo as the main accent and preserve readable hover states
- Define status colors (`green`, `red`, `yellow`) for realtime state indicators

## Seed Tokens
- Background: `#0f0f0f`
- Surface: `#1a1a1a`
- Surface hover: `#242424`
- Border: `#2a2a2a`
- Text: `#e4e4e7`
- Text muted: `#71717a`
- Accent: `#6366f1`
- Accent hover: `#818cf8`

## Application Rule
Prefer CSS variables in root layout for shared theme tokens and avoid duplicated literal colors in components.
