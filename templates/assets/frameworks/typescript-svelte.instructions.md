# Framework Opinion Pack: TypeScript (Svelte)

## Stack Shape
- Keep stores focused and domain-oriented
- Isolate side effects from component rendering paths
- Prefer simple component composition and explicit props/contracts

## Coding Standards
- Keep reactive statements minimal and readable
- Avoid hidden coupling across global stores
- Use typed boundaries for API/data interactions

## Quality Defaults
- Lint/style: strict TS checks + Svelte linting
- Testing: component behavior tests + core domain unit tests

## Starter Bias
Scaffold for velocity with maintainability: theme tokens, route structure, and one real feature slice.
